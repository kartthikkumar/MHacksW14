Word Battles

Description:
With the hope of keeping the user's mind sharp, all the while, providing an engaging and fun experience, this app is designed for individuals or groups of friends. Word Battles is an intellectually stimulating game where the player strives to decipher a word given a jumpled mess of letters.

Multi-players simultaneously race to unscramble one word in the shortest time frame. This word is generated from a selection of words available in our database. Along with this word, players are given hints namely the definition of the word with the hope of growing everyoneâ€™s vocabulary.

In the player-versus-player, or individual mode, a person unscrambled a word presented to them by a friend. The player sending the word will choose from four choices, each that are arbitrarily ranked by difficulty to earn points.   
A player can earn points by guessing words correctly or lose them by submitting incorrectly spelled answers.
